# Circle
The ugliest way to draw a circle

To Run:
To begin, it is assumed that you are using a UNIX system. We will continue as if you are using WSL or Linux and that you are able to run Python code as well.

To begin, just run the setup.py file, I wrote this file to make the compilation process a little easier as it takes a few minutes of commands.

If you want to run it yourself, run the following commands:
```as repack.s -o repack.o```
```gcc repack.o -o repack_executable```
```./repack_executable```
```as circle_recovered.s -o circle.o```
```gcc circle.o -o circle```
```./circle```
